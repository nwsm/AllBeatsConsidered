# AllBeatsConsidered

This script uses [Spotify Web API JS](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js) and [Yahoo Query Language](https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/) to parse NPR's [All Things Considered](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/) page for title/artist of songs they use for interludes and search and add the songs to a [playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/12127460245/playlist/1qO3XzZcwh74JaZ2aQfBNc) if they exist on Spotify.
